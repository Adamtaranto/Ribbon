Ribbon is an interactive web visualization tool for viewing genomic alignments of short/long reads or assembled contigs to any reference genome. 



Ribbon is available online at genomeribbon.com and can even read large bam files straight from your computer without a local install. 

## Local deployment
If you need to deploy Ribbon locally, install XAMPP on your computer (includes Apache and PHP), and then clone this repository into the htdocs folder. On a Mac, this means is at /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/

For example, install XAMPP and then do this on the command line:
```
cd /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/
git clone https://github.com/marianattestad/ribbon
```
Then go to a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (Not tested on IE) and type into the url box:
```
localhost/ribbon
```
That is the entire installation process for Ribbon. Don't you love web applications?
